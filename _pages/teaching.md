**I have served as Instructor of Record for three courses in communication research.**

**1. COMM114S: Communication Technology & Well-Being** 
_Instructor of Record. Stanford University._

(Link to syllabus)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-YikZhSTJIjtpCNgDAfpHsYoONdJPHv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106778559044676175317&rtpof=true&sd=true]
This course investigated the impact of communication technologies on human well-being. We reviewed foundational theories about the role of technology in computer-mediated communication and its implications for intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics. We discussed classical and contemporary research on the effects of diverse media - like social media, smartphones, and personalized algorithms - on 1) psychological well-being and mental health and 2) informational well-being and resilience to problematic online content. Throughout the course, we focused on the complexities of developing and executing media effects research. 

**2. COMM105S: Dynamics of Social Media** (Link to syllabus)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btP2-NThQ0NUg8YI1r-C2O7wYUkg7uQQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106778559044676175317&rtpof=true&sd=true]
_Instructor of Record. Stanford University._
This course provided an introduction to understanding social media and its role in human behavior and society. The course began by discussing the factors that inform and shape the communication process. We examined the interpersonal and psychological aspects of communication with social media, including impression formation, group dynamics, relationships, deception/trust and well-being, culminating in a final project that applied theories from social psychology and communication to modern phenomena in social media.

**3. Stanford University, COMM322: Advanced Studies in Behavior and Social Mediah** (Link to syllabus)
_Co-Instructor of Record. Stanford University._
This is a project-based course focused on advancing graduate research on behavioral approaches to social media. Students will develop or continue a project over the course of the term, approved by the professor, identify research goals and plans for attaining them each week, and present their work both orally and in written reports. This year the focus will be on developing and evaluating digital media interventions on misinformation.
